# get-osmo-votes

Validators can run this script to get an idea of how their delegators are voting, rather than a validator abstaining, maybe they could consider giving some weight to their delegators current votes...Just a personal thought (not a representation of what sunshine is currently practicing...)

Copy and paste into terminal:

`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sryps/get-osmo-votes/main/get-osmo-votes.sh)`

<i>*must have osmosisd binary already installed</i><br>
<i>*must be an active prop</i>
